		<p><b><a name="Installation"></a>Installation</b></p>
		<p>To get started, follow these steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Double click on the &quot;SLIMP3 Server&quot; icon.</li>
			<li>From the Options menu, choose &quot;Set Music Library Folder...&quot;</li>
			<li>Choose the folder that contains your MP3 music, and press the OK button.</li>
			<li>If you want to be able to save playlists that you create with your SLIMP3, choose &quot;Set Saved Playlists Folder...&quot;</li>
			<li>Choose the folder where you want to save your playlists.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>If you'd like to control your SLIMP3 using a web browser, you can do so by opening up your browser and entering a URL like this:</p>
		<p><a href="http://localhost:9000/">http://<em>localhost</em>:9000/</a></p>
		<p>Replace <em>localhost</em> with the IP address of the server computer.</p>
		<p>Finally, this release includes an updater application for the SLIMP3 Player firmware. Open &quot;Firmware Updater&quot; and follow the displayed instructions to update the the firmware on your player to version 2.2. You can check the version number of firmware installed on your SLIMP3 by reading the number at the lower right-hand corner of the display when you plug in your SLIMP3 player.</p>

				<p><b><a name="Remote"></a>Remote Playlist Management </b></p>
		<p>SLIMP3 Server was designed to stream MP3 music to a SLIMP3 Network Music Player. However, it can also stream the same music over the Internet to any software player that supports MP3 streaming.</p>
		<p>First, install the SLIMP3 Server software and make sure the computer to be used as a SLIMP3 Server can be reached over the Internet. If not, you will need to forward port 9000 on your router to the SLIMP3 Server computer.  (Consult your router documentation for instructions). Then:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use your MP3 player software to open a stream to the the URL: <a href="http://localhost:9000/stream.mp3">http://localhost:9000/stream.mp3</a>. (Replace &quot;localhost&quot; with the IP address of the SLIMP3 Server computer).   If you are using the SLIMP3 server's password security, you'll need to use a slightly modified URL like this: <a href="http://username:password@localhost:9000/stream.mp3">http://username:password@localhost:9000/stream.mp3</a>. Some MP3 players will prompt you to enter your username and password.
			<li>Launch the SLIMP3 server web interface running on the remote computer by opening the web page <a href="http://localhost:9000/">http://localhost:9000</a> (Replace &quot;localhost&quot; with the IP address of the remote computer). You will notice a new &quot;player&quot; corresponding to the IP address of the computer with the MP3 software player.
			<li>Use the left pane of the SLIMP3 server web interface to browse and select files and playlists to be played. When music is selected, it will appear in the right pane of the web interface.
			<li>Click on &quot;Play&quot; in the right pane of the SLIMP3 server web interface to launch the music.
			<li>After a couple of seconds, you will hear music playing through the MP3 software player. (The delay is due to buffering in the MP3 player software.)
			<li>To change the content playing, use the SLIMP3 server web interface on the remote machine.
		</ul>

			<p><b><a name="service"></a>SLIMP3 Server as a Windows Service</b></p>
		</div>
		<p>You can optionally run the SLIMP3 server as a Windows Service under Windows NT, 2000 or XP.  On these platforms, the SLIMP3 installer should install and start the SLIMP3 Server service automatically.</p>
		<p>To install and run the SLIMP3 Windows service by hand, follow these instructions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open a &quot;cmd&quot; window and type &quot;<code>cd <em>SLIMP3DIR</em>\server</code>&quot;, 
    replacing <em><code>SLIMP3DIR</code></em> with the path to the folder containing your SLIMP3 Server application.  This is &quot;C:\Program Files&quot; by default.</li>
  <li>Type &quot;<code>slimp3svc -install auto</code>&quot; to install the SLIMP3 server software so it will automatically start as a Windows Service the next time you reboot.
</li>
  <li>You can start or stop the service manually by using &quot;<code>net start 
    slimp3svc</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>net stop slimp3svc</code>&quot; respectively, or by using  the Control Panels-&gt;Administrative Tools-&gt;Services application.</li>
  <li>You can uninstall the service by stopping it, then typing &quot;<code>slimp3svc 
    -remove</code>&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>Windows 98/ME users can use the &quot;Scheduled Tasks&quot; icon to schedule the &quot;SLIMP3 Server&quot; application to start automatically when the computer starts. This will also work for Windows NT/2000/XP users who don't want to use Windows Services.</p>
