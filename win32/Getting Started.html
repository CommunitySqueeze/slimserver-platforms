<p class="p3">Thanks,</p>
<p class="p3">The Logitech Streaming Media Systems Team</p>

<p class="p4"><b><a name="Installation"></a>After Installation</b></p>
<p class="p3">To open up a browser window to SlimServer, click on the SlimServer icon in the Windows task tray in the bottom corner of your screen.</p>
<p class="p3">You can also use the task tray icon to stop or start the SlimServer background service.
<p class="p3">If you use Apple's iTunes, the SlimServer will automatically import your iTunes library information. If you use iTunes to add or remove music from its library, the SlimServer will notice and rescan the song information.</p>

<a NAME="WhatsNew"><p class="p4">What's New in 6.5.2</p></a>
<p class="p3">SlimServer version 6.5.2 incorporates a large number of improvements. The following list includes only the key changes that impact what you see on your screen or change/improve the way you interact with your Squeezebox or Transporter. If you're interested, you can view the <a href="http://svn.slimdevices.com/*checkout*/branches/6.5/server/Changelog6.html">complete list</span></a> of the changes.</p>
<ul>
  <li  class="l1">Localized to 6 languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and Hebrew, including the Mac and Windows installers. Additional languages may be added in later releases. If you're interested in helping with our localization efforts, including translations or testing in native languages, please contact our engineering team at  <a href="mailto:developers@slimdevices.com"><span class="s2">developers@slimdevices.com</span></a>.</li>
  <li  class="l1">Changed the volume control for Squeezebox, Squeezebox2, and Squeezebox v3 to use a 0 to 100 scale.</li>
  <li  class="l1">Added support for saving Albums, Artist, Genres, and Years as favorites.</li>
  <li  class="l1">Made several changes to improve the way SlimServer scans your music library, including: finding only files that have changed since the last scan and finding only files that exist on disk but not in the SlimServer database.</li>
  <li  class="l1">Because Squeezeboxes does not support playback of music that utilizes Digital Rights Management (such as Mircrosoft's Plays for Sure, or Apple's FairPlay), songs in your local music library that have DRM are excluded from the SlimServer database.</li>
  <li  class="l1">Squeezebox2 and Squeezebox v3 now support the Ogg music format natively.</li>
  <li  class="l1">Changed the behavior of searches in numeric lists. The behavior remains the same for lists of 10 or fewer items (keys 1-9 still map directly to the corresponding number, and 0 maps to 10). For longer lists, each key pressed is added to the search; for example, pressing keys 1, 4, 2 will jump you to item 1, then item 14, then item 142 in the list.</li>
  <li  class="l1">If a player loses connection to the server, the display goes blank instead of displaying an error message. Pressing any button on the remote will display the error message. This should prevent users from being woken up in the middle of the night with a bright error message.</li>
  <li  class="l2">For Transporter owners, the behavior of the unique TransNav knob has been improved.</li>
</ul>

<a NAME="Firmware"><p class="p4">Firmware Update</a></p>
<p class="p3">If you own a Squeezebox or Transporter, you may be prompted to update your firmware when it first connects to the SlimServer. Press and hold the Brightness button on the remote control until the firmware update begins.</p>
<p class="p3">If you own a SLIMP3 Player, we recommend that you use the SLIMP3 Firmware Updater to update the firmware on your SLIMP3 player to the latest version, 2.3. This application is available for <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/downloads/firmware/1.3/SLIMP3%20Firmware%20Updater.dmg"><span class="s2">download</span></a>. You can check the version number of firmware installed on your SLIMP3 by reading the number at the lower right-hand corner of the display when you plug in your SLIMP3 player.</p>

<a NAME="RemoteProblem"><p class="p4">Entering a WPA password with the remote control</p></a>
<p class="p3">The Squeezebox and Transporter Users Guide have an error in the section covering WPA passwords.  According to the manual, you would use the PLAY button to insert a character and ADD to delete a character.  This is the opposite of the implementation.  The manual should indicate that ADD inserts a character, and PLAY deletes one.</p>

<a NAME="iTunes"><p class="p4">iTunes library support</a></p>
<p class="p3">If you use Apple's iTunes to manage your music, the SlimServer will automatically import your iTunes library information. If you use iTunes to add or remove music from its library, the SlimServer will notice the change and rescan the song information.</p>
<p class="p8">If you don't want SlimServer to use the iTunes information you will need to specify a folder to use for your music library by launching the SlimServer web interface, click on the Server Settings and specify a folder for your music. If you add or move music in your library, you will need to manually initiate the rescanning by visiting the Server Settings page in the SlimServer web interface and click Rescan.</p>

<p class="p4">A word about songs purchased from the iTunes Music Store</p>
<p class="p3">Because Apple uses a digital rights management (DRM) wrapper around the majority of songs sold through the iTunes Music Store, these files provide limited user rights. One important right that Apple does not grant to you is the right to play that track on a music device not supplied by Apple (one exception is the computer on which you purchased the track). Until Apple changes their position on licensing or eliminating FairPlay, you won't be able to play these tracks on the Squeezebox or Transporter.</p>

<p class="p4">Some of the songs in the iTunes library don't show up in the SlimServer or can't be opened</p>
<p class="p3">If you've moved your iTunes music files around, iTunes can export incorrect information about the songs in its library. You will need to make sure that iTunes has the correct folder for your music library.</p>
<p class="p3">Visit the iTunes Preferences and click on Advanced. If the path to your Music Library folder is incorrect, you'll need to fix it. If it is correct, try changing it to a different folder and then change it back to the correct folder. iTunes will then update the paths to all your music and export that data correctly. (This process won't move any of your music, but it will force iTunes to scan your music library and update the paths to the songs.)</p>
<p class="p3">If this doesn't resolve your problem, iTunes might get confused if you changed the "Keep Music Folder Organized" or "Add Track Number" settings in iTunes. Try changing these settings and then changing them back to have iTunes update the correct information about your music files. Note that having iTunes organizing your music files may involve moving or renaming the files themselves.</p>

<a NAME="Streaming"><p class="p4">Streaming playback via the Internet</a></p>
<p class="p3">The SlimServer was designed to stream MP3 music to a Squeezebox, Transporter or SLIMP3 Network Music Player. As an added bonus, it can also stream the same music over the Internet to any software player that supports MP3 streaming.</p>
<p class="p3">First, install the SlimServer software and make sure the computer to be used as a SlimServer can be reached over the Internet. If not, you will need to forward port 9000 on your router to the SlimServer computer. (Consult your router documentation for instructions). Then:</p>
<ul>
  <li  class="l1">Use your MP3 player software to open a stream to the the URL: <a href="http://localhost:9000/stream.mp3"><span class="s2">http://localhost:9000/stream.mp3</span></a>. (Replace "localhost" with the IP address of the SlimServer computer). If you are using the SlimServer's password security, you'll need to use a slightly modified URL like this: <a href="http://username:password@localhost:9000/stream.mp3"><span class="s2">http://username:password@localhost:9000/stream.mp3</span></a>. Some MP3 players will prompt you to enter your username and password.</li>
  <li  class="l1">Launch the SlimServer web interface running on the remote computer by opening the web page <a href="http://localhost:9000/"><span class="s2">http://localhost:9000</span></a> (Replace "localhost" with the IP address of the remote computer). Youwill notice a new "player" corresponding to the IP address of the computer with the MP3 software player.</li>
  <li  class="l1">Use the left pane of the SlimServer web interface to browse and select files and playlists to be played. When music is selected, it will appear in the right pane of the web interface.</li>
  <li  class="l1">Click on "Play" in the right pane of the SlimServer web interface to launch the music.</li>
  <li  class="l1">After a couple of seconds, you will hear music playing through the MP3 software player. (The delay is due to buffering in the MP3 player software.)</li>
  <li  class="l2">To change the content playing, use the SlimServer web interface on the remote machine.</li>
