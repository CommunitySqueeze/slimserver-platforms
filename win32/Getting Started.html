<a NAME="Install"><p class="p4">Installation</p></a>
<p class="p3">To install SqueezeCenter, double-click the <b>SqueezeCenter Installer</b> and follow the on-screen instructions. The Installer will tell you when the installation process is complete. SqueezeCenter for Windows is installed as an application by default (details on running SqueezeCenter as a service can be found <span class="s1"><a href="#ServiceMode">here</a></span>). Double-click the SqueezeCenter icon in the Windows System Tray to launch the SqueezeCenter web interface.</p>
<p class="p3">The first time you run the web interface, a wizard will walk you through configuring SqueezeCenter for your system.</p>
<p class="p3">If you are upgrading an existing installation of SlimServer to SqueezeCenter, your previous SlimServer settings will be preserved.  However, because of changes to the plug-in architecture, you will need to download and install updated versions of your plug-ins.  Settings specific to plug-ins will not be automatically preserved.  For information on plug-ins, please visit <a href="http://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.php/SqueezeCenter_Plugins"><span class="s2">our wiki</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p3">Information about using SqueezeCenter is available from within the SqueezeCenter by selecting the Help icon located in the lower left corner of the web interface.</p>


<a NAME="WhatsNew"><p class="p4">What's New in 7.0</p></a>
<p class="p3">SqueezeCenter version 7.0 contains significant changes, including a brand-new name! The following list includes the key changes that impact what you see on your screen or change/improve the way you interact with your Squeezebox or Transporter. A <a href="http://svn.slimdevices.com/repos/slim/7.0/trunk/server/Changelog7.html"><span class="s2">complete list</span></a> of changes is also available.</p>
<ul>
  <li class="l1">Renamed SlimServer to SqueezeCenter for consistency with our product naming going forward.</li>
  <li class="l1">SqueezeCenter has a completely new default interface, including a tabbed settings page that makes fine-tuning your set up easier.  If you prefer the "old school" approach, the default web interface from SlimServer 6.5.x has been renamed "Classic" and can be accessed by using <b>http://<i>your server ip</i>:9000/classic</b>.
  <li class="l1">Integrated SqueezeNetwork with SqueezeCenter, eliminating the need to switch between them to access internet-based services or your local music collection.  Services like Pandora Radio, Rhapsody, or Slacker Radio can now be accessed directly from Squeezeboxes or Transporters connected to SqueezeCenter. </li>
  <li class="l1">Completely revamped and improved the synchronization of multiple Squeezeboxes and Transporters.</li>
  <li class="l1">Added support for SqueezeOS-based devices.  (SqueezeOS was formerly referred to as the "Jive software platform".)</li>
  <li class="l1">Revamped the plug-in architecture to provide a more robust, consistent interface.  The drawback is that plug-ins for the SlimServer 6.5.x architecture need to be updated by their authors to be compatible with SqueezeCenter.  Details on SqueezeCenter plug-ins can be found <a href="http://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.php/SqueezeCenter_Plugins"><span class="s2">here</span></a>.</li>
</ul>


<a NAME="ServiceMode"><p class="p4">Running SqueezeCenter as a Service</a></p>
<p class="p3">By default, SqueezeCenter now runs in application mode, starting when you login to Windows.  This allows SqueezeCenter access to your iTunes library, shared folders, or network drive without changing any behavior.  If you want to run SqueezeCenter as a background service on Windows, you will need to run the <b>SqueezeCenter Service Enabler</b>.  Select <b>Startup Manager</b> under SqueezeCenter on the Windows Start menu.</p>
<ul>
  <li class="l1">To run SqueezeCenter as a service, select <b>"Start SqueezeCenter automatically when the computer starts."</b> This will install SqueezeCenter as a service.</li>
  <li class="l2">To run SqueezeCenter as an application, select <b>"Start SqueezeCenter when I log in."</b> This will run SqueezeCenter as an application (the default configuration).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">If you run SqueezeCenter as a background service, you will need to enter your Windows username and password to allow SqueezeCenter access to your iTunes library, shared folders, or network drives.  Use the <b>Next</b> button to accept the changes and exit the application.  You must restart Windows to complete the changes.</p>


<a NAME="Firmware"><p class="p4">Firmware Update</a></p>
<p class="p3">If you own a Squeezebox or Transporter, you may be prompted to update your firmware when it first connects to SqueezeCenter. Press and hold the Brightness button on the remote control until the firmware update begins.</p>


<a NAME="RemoteProblem"><p class="p4">Entering a WPA password with the remote control</p></a>
<p class="p3">Some versions of the Squeezebox and Transporter Users Guide have an error in the section covering WPA passwords.  According to the manual, you would use the PLAY button to insert a character in the password string and ADD to delete a character.  This is the opposite of the implementation.  The manual should indicate that ADD inserts a character, and PLAY deletes one.</p>


<a NAME="iTunes"><p class="p4">iTunes library support</a></p>
<p class="p3">If you use Apple's iTunes to manage your music, SqueezeCenter will automatically import your iTunes library information. If you use iTunes to add or remove music from its library, SqueezeCenter will notice the change and rescan the song information.  You may set the interval between checks on the iTunes tab under Settings on the SqueezeCenter web interface.</p>
<p class="p8">If you don't want SqueezeCenter to use your iTunes database, you will need to change the setting on the iTunes tab under Settings on the SqueezeCenter web interface.  You will need to specify the folder where your music and playlists are stored, then initiate a scan of your music by selecting Rescan from the Basic Settings tab,</p>

<p class="p4">A word about songs purchased from the iTunes Music Store</p>
<p class="p3">Because Apple uses a digital rights management (DRM) wrapper around the majority of songs sold through the iTunes Music Store, these files provide limited user rights. One important right that Apple does not grant to you is the right to play that track on a music device not supplied by Apple (one exception is the computer on which you purchased the track). Until Apple changes their position on licensing or eliminating FairPlay, you won't be able to play these tracks on the Squeezebox or Transporter.</p>

<p class="p4">Some of the songs in the iTunes library don't show up in SqueezeCenter or can't be opened</p>
<p class="p3">If you've moved your iTunes music files around, iTunes can export incorrect information about the songs in its library. You will need to make sure that iTunes has the correct folder for your music library.</p>
<p class="p3">Visit the iTunes Preferences and click on Advanced. If the path to your Music Library folder is incorrect, you'll need to fix it. If it is correct, try changing it to a different folder and then change it back to the correct folder. iTunes will then update the paths to all your music and export that data correctly. (This process won't move any of your music, but it will force iTunes to scan your music library and update the paths to the songs.)</p>
<p class="p3">If this doesn't resolve your problem, iTunes might get confused if you changed the "Keep Music Folder Organized" or "Add Track Number" settings in iTunes. Try changing these settings and then changing them back to have iTunes update the correct information about your music files. Note that having iTunes organizing your music files may involve moving or renaming the files themselves.</p>


<a NAME="Streaming"><p class="p4">Streaming playback via the Internet</a></p>
<p class="p3">SqueezeCenter was designed to stream MP3 music to a Squeezebox, Transporter or SLIMP3 Network Music Player. As an added bonus, it can also stream the same music over the Internet to any software player that supports MP3 streaming.</p>
<p class="p3">First, install SqueezeCenter and make sure the computer to be used as the server can be reached over the Internet. If not, you will need to forward port 9000 on your router to the computer running SqueezeCenter. (Consult your router documentation for instructions). Then:</p>
<ul>
  <li  class="l1">Use your MP3 player software to open a stream to the the URL: <a href="http://localhost:9000/stream.mp3"><span class="s2">http://localhost:9000/stream.mp3</span></a>. (Replace "localhost" with the IP address of the computer running SqueezeCenter). If you are using SqueezeCenter's password security, you'll need to use a slightly modified URL like this: <a href="http://username:password@localhost:9000/stream.mp3"><span class="s2">http://username:password@localhost:9000/stream.mp3</span></a>. Some players will prompt you to enter your username and password.</li>
  <li  class="l1">Launch SqueezeCenter's web interface running on the remote computer by opening the web page <a href="http://localhost:9000/"><span class="s2">http://localhost:9000</span></a> (Replace "localhost" with the IP address of the remote computer). You will notice a new "player" corresponding to the IP address of the computer with the MP3 software player.</li>
  <li  class="l1">Use the left pane of the SqueezeCenter web interface to browse and select the music to be played. When music is selected, it will appear in the right pane of the web interface.</li>
  <li  class="l1">Click on the Play button in the right pane of the SqueezeCenter web interface to begin playing the music.</li>
  <li  class="l1">After a couple of seconds, you will hear music playing through the MP3 software player. (The delay is due to buffering in the MP3 player software.)</li>
  <li  class="l2">To change the content playing, use the SqueezeCenter web interface on the remote machine.</li>
