		<p><b><a name="Installation"></a>Installation</b></p>
		<p>To install the Slim Server software, double-click the <b>Slim Installer</b> and follow the on-screen instructions.  The Installer will tell you when the installation process is complete.</p>
		<p>The Slim Server software for Mac OS X is installed as System Preferences pane. Use this preference pane to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Start and stop the Slim Server software manually or automatically,
			<li>Launch the Slim Server web interface
		</ul>
		<p>If you use Apple's iTunes, the Slim Server will automatically import your iTunes library information. If you use iTunes to add or remove music from its library, the Slim Server will notice and rescan the song information.</p>
		<p>If you don't want Slim Server to use the iTunes information you will need to specify a folder to use for your music library by launching the Slim Server web interface, clicking on the Server Settings and specify a folder for your music. If you add or move music in your library, you will need to manually initiate the rescanning by visiting the Server Settings page in the Slim Server web interface and click Rescan.</p>
		<p><b>Firmware Update</b></p>
		<p>If you own a Squeezebox Player, you may be prompted to update your firmware when it first connects to the Slim Server.  Press and hold the Brightness button on the remote control until the firmware update begins.</p>
		<p>If you own a SLIMP3 Player, we recommend that you use the SLIMP3 Firmware Updater to update the firmware on your SLIMP3 player to the latest version, 2.2. This application is available on the installer disk in the Utilities folder. You can check the version number of firmware installed on your SLIMP3 by reading the number at the lower right-hand corner of the display when you plug in your SLIMP3 player.</p>

		<p><b><a name="Remote"></a>Remote Playlist Management </b></p>
		<p>The Slim Server was designed to stream MP3 music to a Squeezebox or SLIMP3 Network Music Player. However, it can also stream the same music over the Internet to any software player that supports MP3 streaming.</p>
		<p>First, install the Slim Server software and make sure the computer to be used as a Slim Server can be reached over the Internet. If not, you will need to forward port 9000 on your router to the Slim Server computer. (Consult your router documentation for instructions). Then:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use your MP3 player software to open a stream to the the URL: <a href="http://localhost:9000/stream.mp3">http://localhost:9000/stream.mp3</a>. (Replace &quot;localhost&quot; with the IP address of the Slim Server computer). If you are using the Slim Server's password security, you'll need to use a slightly modified URL like this: <a href="http://username:password@localhost:9000/stream.mp3">http://username:password@localhost:9000/stream.mp3</a>. Some MP3 players will prompt you to enter your username and password.
			<li>Launch the Slim Server web interface running on the remote computer by opening the web page <a href="http://localhost:9000/">http://localhost:9000</a> (Replace &quot;localhost&quot; with the IP address of the remote computer). You will notice a new &quot;player&quot; corresponding to the IP address of the computer with the MP3 software player.
			<li>Use the left pane of the Slim Server web interface to browse and select files and playlists to be played. When music is selected, it will appear in the right pane of the web interface.			<li>Click on &quot;Play&quot; in the right pane of the Slim Server web interface to launch the music.			<li>After a couple of seconds, you will hear music playing through the MP3 software player. (The delay is due to buffering in the MP3 player software.)
			<li>To change the content playing, use the Slim Server web interface on the remote machine.		</ul>

		<p><i><a name="aac"></a></i><b>AAC Playback</b></p>
		<p>This version of the Slim Server for Mac or Windows can convert iTunes AAC files to MP3 for playback on Squeezebox or SLIMP3 on-the-fly. To enable this feature, you'll need to install the free (and high quality) LAME MP3 encoder. For more information about LAME in general, <a href="http://lame.sourceforge.net/">click here</a> . LAME is free, but in some countries you may need to pay a license fee in order to legally encode MP3 files. There are several ways to install LAME, including the excellent <a href="http://www.blacktree.com/apps/index.html?iTunes-LAME/index.html">iTunes-LAME Encoder</a> (for Macintosh) or from <a href="http://rarewares.hydrogenaudio.org/mp3.html">Rarewares</a> (for Windows).</p>
		<p>Once you have LAME installed, you should be able to playback iTunes-ripped AAC files (.m4a) as well as the audio from any QuickTime movie (.mov). Music purchased from the Apple Music Store (.m4p files) is protected and cannot be played back with Slim Server until Apple provides the necessary hooks to enable this. In the mean time, it is possible to burn your Apple Music Store songs to CD and re-rip them.</p>
		<p>Note that LAME-based encoding to MP3 for playback can use a substantial amount of CPU power. We continue to recommend high bit-rate MP3 encoded files for best performance, highest audio quality, and best compatibility. <b></b></p>
		<hr>
		<p><a name="Plug-ins"></a><b>Plug-ins &amp; Skins: New location</b></p>
		<p>If you installed Plug-ins or Skins for a previous version of Slim Server or SLIMP3 Server, you will need to re-install them after you upgrade to this version. With this version, you can install plug-ins and skins within the Library folder for the user running the Slim Server. The first time you run the Slim Server, two new folders will be created: <i>Home &gt; Library &gt; SlimDevices &gt; Plugins</i> or <i>Home &gt; Library &gt; SlimDevices &gt; html</i>, use these folders to install third-party plug-ins and skins respectively.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><a name="Some"></a><b>Some of the songs in iTunes library don't show up in the Slim Server or can't be opened. </b></p>
		<p>If you've moved your iTunes music files around, iTunes can export incorrect information about the songs in its library. You will need to make sure that iTunes has the correct folder for your music library.</p>
		<p>Visit the iTunes Preferences and click on Advanced. If the path to your Music Library folder is incorrect, you'll need to fix it. If it is correct, try changing it to a different folder and then change it back to the correct folder. iTunes will then update the paths to all your music and export that data correctly. (This process won't move any of your music, but it will force iTunes to scan your music library and update the paths to the songs.)</p>
		<p>If this doesn't resolve your problem, iTunes might get confused if you changed the &quot;Keep Music Folder Organized&quot; or &quot;Add Track Number&quot; settings in iTunes. Try changing these settings and then changing them back to have iTunes update the correct information about your music files.  Note that having iTunes organizing your music files may involve moving or renaming the files themselves.</p>
